# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

Drowsy driving occurs when a person who is operating a motor vehicle is too tired to remain alert. 
Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy.
Weâ€™ll implement the drowsiness detection algorithm detailed above using OpenCV, dlib, and Python.

Our solution to this problem is to build a detection system that identifies key attributes of drowsiness and triggers an alert when someone is drowsy before it is too late.
